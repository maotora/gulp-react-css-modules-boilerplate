# Gulp react css modules boilerplate.

My gulp css modules boilerplate using react cause i've searched heavens and
hell for this.

Feel free to browse around the project and issue me some mistakes i've made
here and there _still learning._.

## How to use.

Just clone the repo then run :-

```bash

    $ npm install && npm start

```

to get started as quickly as possible.

## Disclaimer.

I'm using `webpack-stream` to run my `react` task with `css modules`.

There is another way of using
[css-modulesify]('https://github.com/css-modules/css-modulesify') but i'm like
wot?? O.o . 
Couldn't keep up with `browserify` and all the things i had to put up with.

If there is another gulp react-css-modules boilerplate *Lemmino* about it so
i can steal some cool concepts.

*Peace out!*
